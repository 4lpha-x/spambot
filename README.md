# spambot
A typing spam bot which help you to spam in social medias...

You can add wordlist of any length. I've added an example wordlist (eg wordlist.txt) so that you can understand the structure of a wordlist.

External module required: pyautogui

Command for external module:
>>> pip install pyautogui

Commands:
>>> git clone https://github.com/4lpha-x/spambot <br>
>>> python spambot.py

Now enter the inputs asked from you and boooooommmm!!!!

Note:- Put the spambot.py and wordlist textfile in the same folder or directory
