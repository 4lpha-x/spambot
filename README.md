# spambot
A typing spam bot which help you to spam in social medias...

It recognizes every line of the wordlist as a message. It types one line of the wordlist then presses enter key.

You can add wordlist of any length. I've added an example wordlist (eg wordlist.txt) so that you can understand the structure of a wordlist.

External module required: pyautogui (Unfortunately this module also doesn't work in android so as the tool)

Command for external module:
>>> pip install pyautogui

Commands:
>>> git clone https://github.com/4lpha-x/spambot <br>
>>> python spambot.py

Now enter the inputs asked from you and boooooommmm!!!!

Note:- Put the spambot.py and wordlist textfile in the same folder or directory

You are free to edit and suggest new changes to this program.
Thanks for your attention...
